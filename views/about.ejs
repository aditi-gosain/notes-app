<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Do you often feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do? Do you
  find yourself missing deadlines? Or do you sometimes just forget to do
  something important, so that people have to chase you to get work done? All of
  these are symptoms of not keeping a proper "To-Do List." These are prioritized
  lists of all the tasks that you need to carry out. They list everything that
  you have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the
  least important tasks at the bottom. By keeping such a list, you make sure
  that your tasks are written down all in one place so you don't forget anything
  important. And by prioritizing tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do
  them, so that you can tell what needs your immediate attention, and what you
  can leave until later.
